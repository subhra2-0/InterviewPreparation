Hibernate:

Hibernate is an orm tool to map java objects to the database.
Hibernate is an implementation of jpa hence we can use the jpa annotation.


=>With session factory we can get the session object for database operation and can cache it to reuse it again and again.

=> session object is basically used for the connection with physical database to facialate the db operation like crud.


trasaction ==> it specifies single unit of work.


in summary: 
the session factory creates a session object for the db operation using session object we can open a db connections and the operation like crud , ane one crud operation can taken as a transaction.
