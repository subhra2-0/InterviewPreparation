Synchronization:
when multiple threads try to acces the same shared resource, synchronization allows us that one thread can only access the shared resource at one time once the execution is completed the next thread will access.
When multiple thread act upon the shared memory or resource there is a possiblity of memory inconsistency and there 
is a chance one thread can intefer other thread. So this is the basic problem if we don't implement the 
synchronization.

Jvm will wait for the user thread to finish their task.
Daemon Threads are threads which are created by the jvm.
This thread mostly performed in background for example garbage collection.
