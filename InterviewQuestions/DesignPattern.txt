SingleTon design pattern-
SingleTon design pattern is a creational designPattern
UseCase: If you have a common sharable data and you want to use across all the classes rather than sharing it
manually using static keyword we can use Singleton class.
java.lang.Runtime , since runtime is unique there should be only one instace of runtime class.

Types of SingleTon:
Eager SingleTon: Where the instance of the class will be created while the class loading.
May lead to resource wastage. Because instance of class is created always, whether it is required or not

Lazy initialization: In this method, object is created only if it is needed. This may prevent resource wastage
