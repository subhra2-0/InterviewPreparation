->HashMapImplementation:


->Why we should override equals and hashcode method?
Answer: to maintain the data consistency in hashing collection.
Suppose for example , in HashMap -> corresponding to keys we check the equals operations, so if there's a hashcollision, than it will keep entries in a linked list structure in bucket other wise if the key is different 
it will override the previous element. if equals method is not implemented then you might find duplicate entries in 
a hashmap where we will face problem with incosistency retrieval.

suppose we don't implement hashcode, then entries with same content might go into different bucket resulting in 
data inconsistency.
